# Layer-Percolation-Simulation
This repository includes code for simulating the generalized layer percolation process, as well as activated random walk simulations on the comb and interval. It is a companion to this paper: 

Included are four documented Jupyter notebooks. CombARWSimulation.ipynb is for sampling the stationary distribution of the driven dissapative ARW process on the interval and comb, CombHockeyStick.ipynb is for simulating the driven dissapative process with central driving on the comb, General_Layer_Percolation_Visualization.ipynb is for simulating the general layer percolation process, and Bounds_on_Comb_Density.ipynb is for simulating the bounds given in the associated comb percolation paper. 

These notebooks should be self contained, however if you have any questions or find any errors please contact me at amorelli@unm.edu.
