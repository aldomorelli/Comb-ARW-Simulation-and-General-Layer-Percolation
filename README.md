# Comb-Percolation-Simulation
This repository includes code for simulating an extension of the layer percolation process to the comb, as well as activated random walk simulations on the comb and interval.

Included are two Jupyter notebooks, one for simulating the ARW process and comparing resulting densities and the other for simulating the comb percolation process.
