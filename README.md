# Layer-Percolation-Simulation
This repository includes code for simulating the generalized layer percolation process, as well as activated random walk simulations on the comb and interval.

Included are three documented Jupyter notebooks. CombARWSimulation.ipynb is for sampling the stationary distribution of the driven dissapative ARW process on the interval and comb, CombHockeyStick.ipynb is for simulating the driven dissapative process with central driving on the comb, and General_Layer_Percolation_Visualization.ipynb is for simulating the general layer percolation process. 

These notebooks should be self contained, however if you have any questions or find any errors please contact me at amorelli@unm.edu.
